                    <p className='mission-p'>
                        Lennon Window Cleaning was started in 2023 by Micah Patterson and his wife Lauren. After 8 years in the window cleaning industry, Micah decided to start his own company to support his growing family. Their daughter, Lennon Louise, was born on January 20th, 2023 and she went to Heaven on January 22nd, 2023.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        After experiencing this devastating loss, Micah and Lauren have embarked on a new journey: starting a window cleaning business that carries her love, legacy and her name.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Through our window cleaning services, we aim to provide exceptional quality and an unparalleled attention to detail. Our ultimate goal is to brighten the lives and spaces of our clients, just as our daughter brightened ours with her beautiful spirit.
